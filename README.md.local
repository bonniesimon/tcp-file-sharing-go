### Logs

#### 17 July 2024
- In case of a web server, the server is the application we write and the client is the browser (or curl). Thus we need two programs. That is why we see client and server in the related go projects that we look at.
- Connect to TCP server using curl
  ```
  ‚ùØ curl -v telnet://127.0.0.1:3005
  ```
- TCP socket primitives:
  SOCKET:    Create a new communication endpoint
  BIND:      Associate a local address with a socket
  LISTEN:    Announce willingness to accept connections; give queue size
  ACCEPT:    Passively establish an incoming connection
  CONNECT:   Actively attempt to establish a connection
  SEND:      Send some data over the connection
  RECEIVE:   Receive some data from the connection
  CLOSE:     Release the connection
