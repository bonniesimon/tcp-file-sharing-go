### Logs

#### 20 July 2024
- Todo today:
  - [x] Send a message through the TCP connection
  - [x] Send a file through the TCP connection
- Everything on a unix system is a file. So if I want to communicate with a network, then there is a file associated with it. So I need to get the file descriptor to that file (file descriptor is kinda like an identifier for an open file). In order to get the file descriptor for network communication, you have to use the `socket` system call
- Accept is blocking. The program execution waits at this command until we get a connection
- So basically croc is doing something similar to a file server. So you request a file and they'll send you the file. So from the client you ask for a file with say a fileName, then from the server we'll send the file via tcp
- I can now design the server in such a way that I should send a file by chunks over TCP

#### 17 July 2024
- In case of a web server, the server is the application we write and the client is the browser (or curl). Thus we need two programs. That is why we see client and server in the related go projects that we look at.
- Connect to TCP server using curl
  ```
  ‚ùØ curl -v telnet://127.0.0.1:3005
  ```
- TCP socket primitives:
  SOCKET:    Create a new communication endpoint
  BIND:      Associate a local address with a socket
  LISTEN:    Announce willingness to accept connections; give queue size
  ACCEPT:    Passively establish an incoming connection
  CONNECT:   Actively attempt to establish a connection
  SEND:      Send some data over the connection
  RECEIVE:   Receive some data from the connection
  CLOSE:     Release the connection
- Next step is implementing the case where we can keep sending stuff to the server without the server closing. I should checkout the initial commit of croc to see how they do this
